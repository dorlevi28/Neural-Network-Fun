# Stop Sign Identifier
 used a simple 9 layer convenutinal Neural Networkd with 2 dropout layers of 0.25 and MaxPolling.
 #
 We used Training Data with all sort of traffic sign images when: Stop Sign was given label 1 otherwise 0.
 In this curreunt configuration we mangaged to get 99% accuracy on both train and test set.
